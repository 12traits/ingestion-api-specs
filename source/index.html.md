# Introduction

Welcome to the 12traits Ingestion API!

The 12traits API is a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API, which accepts and returns JSON-encoded data, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

# Authentication

The 12traits API uses API Keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API Keys in the 12traits Dashboard.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

> Send your API Key with the request.

```shell
curl -XPOST -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" https://api.12traits.com
```

# API limits

- It is possible to push up to 1000 multiple items at the same time.

# List your games

You will need to know your game ID in order to push data. You can get this ID by calling this endpoint.
