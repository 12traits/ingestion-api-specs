# Introduction

Welcome to the 12traits Ingestion API!

The 12traits API is a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API, which accepts and returns JSON-encoded data, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

# REST API Endpoints

We value security, so only HTTPS is supported.

## Production

[https://api.12traits.com](https://api.12traits.com)

## Sandbox

[https://sandbox.api.12traits.com](https://sandbox.api.12traits.com)

- Use the Sandbox endpoint during the implementation phase.
- Switch to the Production endpoint once the testing is completed.

# Authentication

The 12traits API uses API Keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API Keys in the 12traits Dashboard. Each game has its own API Key.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

> Send your API Key with the request.

```shell
curl -XPOST -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" https://api.12traits.com/v1/games/...
```

# API limits

- It is possible to push up to 1000 multiple items at the same time.

# Postman Collection

<a href="https://www.getpostman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> is helpful when first integrating with the 12traits API. Postman is a powerful tool that will help you call and debug specific response data, as well as any error messages.

## How to use 12traits API Postman Collection

1. Go to <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6074213/SVtZvRPm">https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6074213/SVtZvRPm</a>
2. Click "Run in Postman"
3. Set your environment variables in Postman App

### 12traits API variables

- **BASE_URL** - Production - https://api.12traits.com, or sandbox - https://sandbox.api.12traits.com
- **API_KEY** - Paste your game API Key here

Now you are ready to test 12traits API endpoints from Postman!
